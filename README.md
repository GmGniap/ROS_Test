Dear Viewer , 
This repo is ROS package of 'Design and Implementation of Robot Walker for Elderly/Disable People by using Localization Algorithm' 2018
,that is my graduation thesis for Precision Engineering,University of Technology(Yatanapon Cyber City).

In here , I'll place all my works and will add 'Error Notes','Solidwork CAD design sheet' and 'Installation Guide',that took notes while I was working with my walker bot.

And some parts of my work need to credit to Dr.Rainer Hessmer,Mr.Letin Joseph and so,I would like to add special thanks and respect to them.

And another nominated person is my supervisor Dr.Aung Ko,head of Precision Department. ^_^
